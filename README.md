TODO: The text below is under construction.

This is a framework for detecting memory issues in Dart and Flutter
applications. It enables:

2. [Memory usage tracking and auto-snapshotting](doc/USAGE.md).

Documentation:
1. [Understand leak tracking concepts](doc/CONCEPTS.md)
2. [Troubleshoot memory leaks](doc/TROUBLESHOOT.md)
